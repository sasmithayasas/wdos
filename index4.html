          <h1>Trivia</h1>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="">The dark spots on a leopard are called “rosettes” because their shape is similar to that of a rose.<br> Baby leopards are born with barely visible spots, which emerge as they get older.</a></li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="">Black coated (or melanistic) leopards, where the spots are indistinguishable, are commonly called black panthers. <br>They are often mistakenly thought to be a different species. In other words, the panther is simply a black leopard.</a></li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="">Sloth bears have shaggy, dusty-black coats; pale, short-haired muzzles; and long, curved claws which they use to excavate termites and ants.</a></li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="">The leopard is a strong and agile climber who is often found resting on a tree branch during the day. <br> After a kill, leopards will often stash their prey in a tree to prevent other animals such as hyenas and lions from stealing it, and they enjoy the meal for several days.</a></li>
            <br>
            <li><a href="">Leopards are the smallest of the large cats, which includes lions, tigers and jaguars. <br>Female leopards weigh 46 to 132 pounds and males can be up to 50% bigger, weighing 80 to 165 pounds. The average length of a leopard is between three and six feet..</a></li>

                  <h2>The survival of the Sri Lankan leopard is primarily threatened by increasing habitat loss and fragmentation, together with an increasing risk of human-induced mortality.</h2> <br><br>

                    Leopards are killed by people either accidentally in wire snares set for other species, or as retaliation after livestock depredation (usually through poisoning the livestock carcass).<br> They are also occasionally shot. Since 2010, over 90 leopards are known to have been killed by people in Sri Lanka. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_leopard#:~:text=The%20survival%20of%20the%20Sri,risk%20of%20human%2Dinduced%20mortality."><b>Click here for more info</b></a>
