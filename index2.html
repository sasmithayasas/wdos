                Being omnivorous, it feeds on nuts, berries, and roots, as well as carrion and meat. One of its main staples is insects, which it removes from rotting stumps and trees with its long, hairless snout. Otherwise, it rarely kills animals.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sri_Lankan_sloth_bear"><b>Click here for more info</b></a>
