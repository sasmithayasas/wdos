                Sri Lanka is an island close to the southern end of India with a tropical environment. The invertebrate fauna is as large as it is common to other regions of the world. <br>There are about two million species of arthropods found in the world, and still it is counting with many new species still being discovered. <br>It is very complicated and difficult to summarize the exact number of species found within a certain region.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_freshwater_crabs_of_Sri_Lanka"><b>Click here for more info</b></a>
